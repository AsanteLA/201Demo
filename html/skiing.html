    <h1>This is the Skiing Page</h1>
    <p>Skiing in Utah is world-renowned, offering pristine powder, breathtaking mountain views, and top-tier resorts like Park City, Snowbird, and Alta. The dry, fluffy snow—often called “The Greatest Snow on Earth”—creates ideal conditions for both beginners and pros. Just minutes from Salt Lake City, adventure awaits on every slope and trail.</p>
